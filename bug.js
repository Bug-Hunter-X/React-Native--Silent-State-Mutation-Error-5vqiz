This error occurs when you are using a state variable within a functional component and you try to modify the state directly by assigning a new value to it.  This is incorrect because React needs to manage the state updates internally using the `setState` method.  Directly modifying the state variable leads to React not re-rendering the component and results in unexpected behavior or no changes reflecting in the UI.
